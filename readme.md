Homomorphic Encryption Over Finite Fields
-------------------
This repository contains an implemenation of a homomorphic encryption algorithm. It is effectively the same construction in [Fully Homomorphic Encryption Over The Integers](https://eprint.iacr.org/2009/616.pdf), but is performed over finite fields instead of over integers.
